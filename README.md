Final Project; DSC80

## Introduction:
- Diet is an important contributor to overall well being
- Talk about processed foods/introduction/overall negative impact
  >- Processed food tends to have high sodium, low potassium
  >- According to the FDA a food is 'high' in something if it is over 20% of the PDV
- People have less time to cook-> find research-> is this true?
- https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/lows-and-highs-percent-daily-value-nutrition-facts-label#:~:text=The%20percent%20Daily%20Value%20(%25,or%20low%20in%20a%20nutrient.

- Do more simple recipies have higher ratings?
- Do more simple recipies have lower sodium?

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
### Univariate Plots
- N_steps histogram
- Sodium level histogram
### Bivariate Plots
- High sodium vs low sodium n_steps, boxplot
### Interesting Aggregates
- Since Americans statistically consume too much sodium, I wanted to see if high sodium recipies were more highly rated
## Assessment of Missingness

## Hypothesis Testing
- Will most likely be a prediction problem

## Framing a Prediction Problem

## Baseline Model

## Final Model

## Fairness Analysis
